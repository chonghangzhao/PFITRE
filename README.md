# PFITRE

## Overview
This repository contains Perception Fused Iterative Tomography Reconstruction Engine (PFITRE), which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with perceptional knowledge as a smart regularizer into an iterative solving engine to correct limited-angle induced artifacts in X-ray tomography images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using various experimental datasets obtained with different x-ray microscopy techniques.

## Examples

We provide an approach for using PFITRE for iterative correction, as well as a one-time post-correction option with the pretrained network for testing and comparison.
