# PFITRE

This repository contains Perception Fused Iterative Tomography Reconstruction Engine (PFITRE), which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with perceptional knowledge as a smart regularizer into an iterative solving engine to correct limited-angle induced artifacts in X-ray tomography images. 

We also provide a one-time post-correction method with the pretrained network for testing and comparison.
